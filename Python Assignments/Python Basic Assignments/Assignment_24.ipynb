    "\n",
    "**LAMBDA**\n",
    " - a lambda expression can have only one result, which is returned from the function produced\n",
    " - a lambda expression is an expression that evaluates to a function object, but a def statement has no value and \n",
    "   constructs a function object and binds it to a name.\n",
    " - the working of a lambda is similar to any other functions created by Python.\n",

    "**Ans:** The differences between map, filter and reduce are: \n",
    "\n",

    " - Map Function takes 2 arguments as an input i.e. the function and the iterable object.\n",
    " - Iterables objects can be list, tuples or strings\n",
    " - The function is applied on the iterables and the transformed iterables is achieved\n",
    " - Syntax : map(function, iterables)\n",
    "\n",
    "**FILTER:**\n",
    " - Filter is a funtion which applies some operation on the sequence and only those values of the sequence  which \n",
    "   evaluates to True are operated\n",
    " - In simple words: filter is applied on only those sequence that matches the condition.\n",
    " - Syntax : map(function, iterables) \n",
    "\n",
    "**REDUCE:**\n",
    " - Reduce is a function which perfoms a recursive calculation on the pairs of values in a sequence and returns a result.\n",
    " - Syntax : reduce(function, sequence[, initial])"

    "**Ans:** Some of the general design guidelines for coding functions are:\n",
    "1. Always use a docstring to explain the functionality of the function\n",
    "2. avoid using or limited use of global variables\n",
    "3. Proper Identation to increase the code readability\n",

    "5. Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    "6. try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
    "7. Local variables should be named using camelCase format `(ex: localVariable)` whereas Global variables names should be using PascalCase `(ex:GlobalVariable)`. \n",
